# Optical_Disc_Segmentation

## The goal is to accurately segment optical discs for detecting glaucoma.

| Task             | Current Approach                                            |
|----------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------|
|Generating Labels | Using Canny Edge Detection and Exploiting contour properties|
|Building the model| U-Net like architecture                                     |



### To do:
- [ ] Data Augmentation.
- [ ] Test the model on drions-DB dataset.
- [ ] Modify the architecture for better accuracy.
